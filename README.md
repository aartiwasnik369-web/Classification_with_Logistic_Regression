# Logistic Regression Binary Classification

This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

The dataset was cleaned, encoded, and standardized before splitting into training and testing sets.  
Model performance was evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

The project also includes ROC curve visualization and threshold tuning for performance analysis.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
